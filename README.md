# login-app-asp.net
This is a basic application created used ASP.NET and Firebase. You can either create a new user or login with the default username = "newUser" and password = "userPassword".  At the moment, all this application does is allow the user to login, take a multiplication test, and see their results as well as their overall best score.

This was my first time working with ASP.NET and I really enjoyed the framework. Ideally, instead of a basic math test, this application would allow users to take ACT/SAT practice tests in any of the sections that they need help with between Math, Reading, English, and Science. At the moment I am not sure of the best way to go about this since as far as I know there are not any APIs available that would provide this type of data.
